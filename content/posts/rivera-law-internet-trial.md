We are a leading law firm specializing in Internet law. What sets us apart from the many Internet lawyers that are appearing on the web is our unique technical capabilities and record of ground breaking results. Any attorney can set up a website, claim to specialize in Internet law, and add a couple of superlatives. Our Internet law firm looks forward to discussing specifics where our representation provides unique Internet law technical capabilities. For example, attorney Domingo J. Rivera was the first attorney in the United States to win a complex Internet case involving copyright infringement allegations against the U.S. Department of Justice. Prior to that, the DOJ had a 100% percent conviction rate in these cases. The Internet law copyright case that Domingo J. Rivera involved an individual accused of being the leader of the largest music piracy case in the world. A jury heard this Internet law copyright case and returned a verdict in our favor. 

However, our success in Internet law is not limited to Internet copyright infringement cases. We have obtained favorable results in several matters involving trademark infringement, computer trespass, Internet defamation and many others. Sometimes we have even obtained summary judgment in Internet law cases in various federal courts. Our cases have been heard in Virginia, Texas, California, Florida, Arkansas, Arizona, New York, and others. We have assisted clients around the world, from England, the UK, New Zealand, Australia, and even U.S. service members residing in the Middle East. The Internet knows no geographical borders. As Internet lawyer, we assist our clients in determining whether to prosecute (or defend) Internet copyright infringement allegations, whether a trademark is valid, whether Internet posts in blogs, forums, blogspot.com, even Facebook, are actionable as Internet defamation or whether they are protected by the First Amendment. We assist our clients in uncovering the authors of these anonymous Internet posts.
